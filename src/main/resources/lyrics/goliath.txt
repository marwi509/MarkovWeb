that night I remember
what you slipped in my glass
we came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth
while the lights winked at me
and now my shape is kept
the rain it can't hide
wash the pain from this hex
is it so permanent
did she catch the left eye
when it blinks three times
or once just to seal you in
in your drunken breath
did it stain like us
in place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intentions
swap the corpse
in a casket
give me that corpse please
the one that tore nightly
I really want it now
fold the arms slowly
don’t want you to hold me
if fits just like a glove
does it make you feel alright
when I seep inside your truth
through suspicious little coughs
you sink your nails inside a key
while the door you shut closed up
the black stockings you kept
smell of wet cigarettes
torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault
to have you keep me here
on this leash
for the rest of your pets
I will feed to the theft
as we consummate the vows of defeat
and when you pray for an end to this
I do believe this is eternity
give me that corpse please
the one that tore nightly
I really want it now
fold the arms slowly
don’t want you to hold me
if fits just like a glove
your closet is bulging
white marrow withholding
does it make you feel alright?
never heard a man
speak like this man before
never heard a man
speak like this man before
all the days of my life
ever since I’ve been born
never heard a man
speak like this man before
watch me now
say it loud
hold your heavy burden
in a pocket full of drink that I’ve drunk
spit the remnants in your direction
this is the closest to any kingdom
that you will come
I’m starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
it's numbing a stump
clearing in my throat
and I just can't lose grip of it
she fumigates my mental hygiene
I’m all out of pulse
but I know you can resuscitate me
never heard a man
speak like this man before
never heard a man
speak like this man before
all the days of my life
ever since I been born
never heard a man
speak like this man before
watch me now
