I wanted to write a song about the three loves of my life that have slipped away some how...but, i could only come up with two

I was in love with an albino
Her lack of pigment seemed like fun
Her skin, the whitest alabaster
Her eyes as pink, as pink as bubble gum

Then one day it snowed real hard,
And she disappeared
That's one
Here's two

I love little Agnus Johnson
I met her at the old folks home
She'd call me up and say hey Stephen
Come give old Mother Hubbard a bone
Then one day her EKG went beep, beep, beep-contin. 

Had to see you one last time
There's something on my mind
How do i say what needs to be said?
The words are hard to find
How about bitch give me my money
I want my money and i wwant it fast
Hey, bitch give me my money
Else i'm bout to take it out your ass
This is for my little girl
My lady gives birth today
I run to her room right away
She smiles with glee, and hands her to me
I look at my newborn and say

Damn that's an ugly baby
Damn that's an ugly ass baby
I'm feeling quite concerned
My semen must have turned
'Cause damn that's an ugly baby

I can't believe this came from me
I think her mom did too much LSD
She's skinny like a twig
At least her nuts are big
But the placenta is cuter than she

Damn that's an ugly baby
God damn that's an ugly ass baby
I can't take her home today
She'll scare the dog away
'cause damn that's an ugly baby

And when she smiles I find
Shane McGowen comes to mind
It makes me want to cry
When I look into her good eye
I always wanted kids
Is it wrong to hope for SIDS?
Then the doctor calls me in
Mr. Lynch she has a twin

Damn that's a good-lookin' baby
One for two on the good lookin' babies
I almost start to weep
Now this one we can keep
Cause that was an ugly ass...

Damn that's an ugly baby (x4)
She's got one good tooth and one ear and one eye
And thank god just one nose, but it's on her left thigh
Now doctor I am asking you guy to guy
Would a really really really late term abortion still fly?
Oh no, not me!
I don't want no ugly baby!
I said damn that's an ugly ass baby
Damn that's an ugly ass baby...

       F             Bb         F                       F
The screen door slams  Mary's dress waves       Like a vision she dances 
   C                       Bb                                          C
across the porch    As the radio plays    Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
            F                 Bb                                  F
Hey that's me and I want you only    Don't turn me home again  I just can't face 
   C
myself alone again
       F                        Bb                       F
Don't run back inside    darling you know just what I'm here for
                                             C                   Bb
So you're scared and you're thinking   That maybe we ain't that young anymore
                                           C
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
             F                        Bb              F                  C
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright   Oh and that's alright with me
         F                            Dm                    F
You can hide neath your covers  And study your pain  Make crosses from your lovers
      Bb                F                    Am
Throw roses in the rain   Waste your summer praying in rain
       Bb                           C7              F
For a saviour to rise from these streets   Well now I'm no hero
       Dm                     F                               Bb
That's understood  All the redemption I can offer, girl Is beneath this dirty hood
F                          Am                 Bb                 C7
 With a chance to make it good somehow  Hey what else can we do now
        F                     Bb                     F
Except roll down the window   And let the wind blow back your hair
                                        C                    Bb
Well the night's busting open   These two lanes will take us anywhere
                                   C          F                            Bb
We got one last chance to make it real   To trade in these wings on some wheels
                 F                 C
Climb in back   Heaven's waiting on down the tracks   
F           Dm               F                    Bb
Oh oh come take my hand     Riding out tonight to case the promised land  
F  Am               Bb              C7
Oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road  
 F                      Dm                        F
Lying out there like a killer in the sun      Hey I know it's late 
        Bb                 F         Am         Bb          C7             F
we can make it if we run   Oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold   Thunder Road
       Bb                        C                         F
Well I got this guitar    And I learned how to make it talk
       Dm                                              Bb   C
And my car's out back    If you're ready to take that long walk
           Bb                      C               Am                          Dm
From your front porch to my front seat  The door's open but the ride it ain't free
       Bb              Bb/A               Gm7      Bb/F
And I know you're lonely   For words that I ain't spoken
       C
But tonight we'll be free    All the promises'll be broken
             F                        Bb              F
There were ghosts in the eyes    Of all the boys you sent away
                                           C                 Bb
They haunt this dusty beach road  In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
                                            C                 F
They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at 
    Bb                        Am
their feet        And in the lonely cool before dawn
               Bb                                Gm                        C
You hear their engines roaring on   But when you get to the porch they're gone
       Bb                  Gm            Bb
On the wind, so Mary climb in    It's a town full of losers
         C                      F  F
And I'm pulling out of here to win.
F    C    F    Bb      F    C    Bb    C
Hush, little girl
Sweet baby don't cry, tonight
Daddy is here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby, tonight

Pre-chorus:
Am           C              G     D
Why can't it all be like it was before?
Am           C                    G        D
How can I explain why mommy's not here, anymore?

Chorus:
       G           D         Em         C
'Cause daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores
G          D          Em          C
Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores 
G           D        Em            C           G   D
Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus 
        Em         C          G  D  Em
I think that's why mommy left us
C          G  D  D
Mommy left us

Verse 2: (verse riff)
Hush, little girl 
There is no reason to fret, tonight 
Don't mind the smoke, daddy just wants to forget, tonight

Pre-chorus:
Am           C              G     D
Soon it will all be like it was before 
Am  C                     G                  D     D
Any minute, she will walk through that front door 

Chorus:
    G           D         Em             C
But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer 
G             D          Em             C
Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear
G         D            Em            C           G    D
Daddy has sores on his naughty parts oozing with pus
        Em         C          G   D  G  D
I think that's why mommy left us 

Bridge:
C            D
Please don't cry
  C          D
I swear I'll try
   C       Am      D
To be here by your side 

Verse 3:
G           D          Em            C
Right after daddy gets home from the bar 
G          D          Em           C
Visits his bookee and steals a new car 
      G            D              Em       C               G      D
He'll drive to the strip club and if daddy plays his cards right 
            Em            C       G
He'll bring home your new mommy tonight
